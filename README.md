Here is several npm scripts:

```bash
npm run build # compile typescript files
npm run download-dynamic-prices # generate orders
npm run seed # write orders to the mongodb
npm run cronjob # run cronjob on every 5th minute
npm run http # run rest api to fetch result
```

Environment variables:
```bash
MONGO_CONN_STRING=mongodb://localhost:27017/elephantstock # mongodb connection string
PORT=3000 # server port
LINES=1000 # number of lines to write in the DB
```

GET http://localhost:3000 will respond result of the cronjob
```JSON

### Technical task

The technical task aims to be as close as possible with our company's dataset and
daily challenges for our team. Now... Imagine a special company: "Dynamic
Prices Ltd". It was founded about 15 years ago, at the beginning of the year 2005. 
The company has a unique selling strategy: Daily dynamic prices for all the products!
Each night, a special cron job runs and changes the price of each
product variant. Each product has four different variants: S, M, L, XL. 
The company has more than 1 million orders. The stakeholder team wishes to improve sales
this year, and for that it must gather insights about the company's historic sales.
The company wants to know which products have the best performance, and more specifically, 
which variants out of those products are the most "successful". 
The insights should come in a form of a report for each product variant in the past 30 days, 90 days, 180
days and 365 days. The report must contain two import aggregation fileds:

- cashFlow. This field represents the sum of prices.
- sales. This field represents the amount of placed orders.

The output format of the report must be JSON. 

The entire dataset of the company is available to you -
Please execute the following command on your local machine to generate it:

```
npm run download-dynamic-prices
```

The command "downloads" all orders to your local machine. Each row has the
following attributes:

- productId
- variant. The variants can be: S, M, L, XL.
- order meta data. The object contains the order date and the dynamic price.

Note: If you're not familiar with `jsonl` as a format please visit:
[https://jsonlines.org/examples](https://jsonlines.org/examples).

The final goal of having this insightful report is achievable ONLY by "killing" 3 mystical creatures.

#### Creature 1: The parser

You need to build a parser. The parser must extract and save these 1,000,000+
records in mongodb collection(s).

Hint: Each product id occurs multiple times in the report.

#### Creature 2: The aggregator

You need to build a cron job if you want to kill this creature. The cron job
accumulates product variant orders in the past 30 days, 90 days, 180 days and
365 days.

#### Creature 3: REST API Call

The stakeholder teams wants to know the best selling product variants in the
last 30 days, 90 days, 180 days and 365 days. The output format must be:
